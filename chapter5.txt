This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. 
This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length 
of a day will have increased to 25 hours.
